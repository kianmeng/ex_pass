# ExPass

ExPass is a robust Elixir library designed to simplify the creation of digital passes
compatible with mobile wallet applications, such as Apple Wallet. It enables developers
to generate and manage various types of passes, including boarding passes, coupons,
event tickets, store cards, and generic passes, all in compliance with the latest
pass specifications.
